```bash
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to check the commit log message taken by
# applypatch from an e-mail message.
#
# The hook should exit with non-zero status after issuing an
# appropriate message if it wants to stop the commit.  The hook is
# allowed to edit the commit message file.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed
# by applypatch from an e-mail message.
#
# The hook should exit with non-zero status after issuing an
# appropriate message if it wants to stop the commit.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "pre-applypatch".

. git-sh-setup
precommit="$(git rev-parse --git-path hooks/pre-commit)"
test -x "$precommit" && exec "$precommit" ${1+"$@"}
:
```

- commit-msg.sample

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to check the commit log message.
# Called by "git commit" with one argument, the name of the file
# that has the commit message.  The hook should exit with non-zero
# status after issuing an appropriate message if it wants to stop the
# commit.  The hook is allowed to edit the commit message file.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "commit-msg".

# Uncomment the below to add a Signed-off-by line to the message.
# Doing this in a hook is a bad idea in general, but the prepare-commit-msg
# hook is more suited to it.
#
# SOB=$(git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT | sed -n 's/^\(.*>\).*$/Signed-off-by: \1/p')
# grep -qs "^$SOB" "$1" || echo "$SOB" >> "$1"

# This example catches duplicate Signed-off-by lines.

test "" = "$(grep '^Signed-off-by: ' "$1" |
         sort | uniq -c | sed -e '/^[   ]*1[    ]/d')" || {
        echo >&2 Duplicate Signed-off-by lines.
        exit 1
}
```

- pre-commit.sample

``` bash
# An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
# Called by "git commit" with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.
```

- prepare-commit-msg.sample

```bash
# An example hook script to prepare the commit log message.
# Called by "git commit" with the name of the file that has the
# commit message, followed by the description of the commit
# message's source.  The hook's purpose is to edit the commit
# message file.  If the hook fails with a non-zero status,
# the commit is aborted.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "prepare-commit-msg".

# This hook includes three examples. The first one removes the
# "# Please enter the commit message..." help message.
#
# The second includes the output of "git diff --name-status -r"
# into the message, just before the "git status" output.  It is
# commented because it doesn't cope with --amend or with squashed
# commits.
#
# The third example adds a Signed-off-by line to the message, that can
# still be edited.  This is rarely a good idea.
```

- fsmonitor-watchman.sample

```bash
# An example hook script to integrate Watchman
# (https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) with git to speed up detecting
# new and modified files.
#
# The hook is passed a version (currently 1) and a time in nanoseconds
# formatted as a string and outputs to stdout all files that have been
# modified since the given time. Paths must be relative to the root of
# the working tree and separated by a single NUL.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "query-watchman" and set
# 'git config core.fsmonitor .git/hooks/query-watchman'
```

- post-update.sample

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to prepare a packed repository for use over
# dumb transports.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "post-update".

exec git update-server-info
```


- pre-push.sample

```bash
# An example hook script to verify what is about to be pushed.  Called by "git
# push" after it has checked the remote status, but before anything has been
# pushed.  If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing will be pushed.
#
# This hook is called with the following parameters:
#
# $1 -- Name of the remote to which the push is being done
# $2 -- URL to which the push is being done
#
# If pushing without using a named remote those arguments will be equal.
#
# Information about the commits which are being pushed is supplied as lines to
# the standard input in the form:
#
#   <local ref> <local sha1> <remote ref> <remote sha1>
#
# This sample shows how to prevent push of commits where the log message starts
# with "WIP" (work in progress).
```

- pre-rebase.sample

```bash
# The "pre-rebase" hook is run just before "git rebase" starts doing
# its job, and can prevent the command from running by exiting with
# non-zero status.
#
# The hook is called with the following parameters:
#
# $1 -- the upstream the series was forked from.
# $2 -- the branch being rebased (or empty when rebasing the current branch).
#
# This sample shows how to prevent topic branches that are already
# merged to 'next' branch from getting rebased, because allowing it
# would result in rebasing already published history.
```

- pre-receive.sample

```bash
# An example hook script to make use of push options.
# The example simply echoes all push options that start with 'echoback='
# and rejects all pushes when the "reject" push option is used.
```

- update.sample

```bash
# An example hook script to block unannotated tags from entering.               
# Called by "git receive-pack" with arguments: refname sha1-old sha1-new        
#                                                                               
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".                            
#

# hooks.allowunannotated                                                        
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the         
#   repository.  By default they won't be.

#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the

#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default  
#   it won't be.                                                                
# hooks.allowdeletebranch                                                       
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the          
#   repository.  By default they won't be.                                      
# hooks.denycreatebranch                                                        
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied         
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.
